Feature: Schedule a talk
  In order to ensure attendees can attend the talks of their choice from a published schedule
  As a BarCamp admin
  I want to match talks with locations and times for an active Barcamp
  
Background:
  Given an active BarCamp "BarCamp Charlotte III"
  And   "jim@jimvanfleet.com" has pitched "Inside the BarCamp scheduling application"
  And   "cbeck@netphase.com" has pitched "Your iPad application"
  And   "scott@netphase.com" has pitched "Your business and the iPhone"
